## Key Challenges

1. **Agent Assignment Efficiency**: Current methods for assigning agents to user queries lack sophistication, leading to suboptimal user-agent pairing and potentially lower customer satisfaction.
2. **Interaction History Management**: Existing systems struggle to efficiently summarize and store interaction histories, hindering analytical insights and timely retrieval.
3. **Customization Limitations**: Many chatbots do not offer robust customization options for creating specialized agents tailored to unique business needs and customer preferences.
4. **Technological Integration**: Integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) models into a cohesive architecture poses integration challenges and requires robust technical solutions.

api_key: ""
model_name: "llama3-70b-8192"
max_tokens: 4096
temperature: 0.9
top_p: 1
stream: false
agent: "assistant"
bot_name: "Manav"
default_system_message: "You are ${bot_name}, an exceptionally intelligent and open-minded ${agent}. 
Always retain and utilize information from previous messages, particularly 
the user's name and any personal details they share. Provide insightful, 
thoughtful, and helpful responses to all inquiries, ensuring empathy, 
respect, and consideration are maintained."
```

## Documentation
