This is because it iterates over all prompts to find a match.\n* Note: The `templates` parameter has a default value that calls `load_templates()` when the function is first defined. This means that the `load_templates()` function is called only once, when the module is loaded, and the result is cached. This is a form of memoization.\n\n**3. `save_templates(templates, file_path=TEMPLATES_FILE_PATH)`**:\n\n* This function saves the templates to a JSON file specified by `file_path`.\n* It uses the `json` module to dump the templates dictionary to the file.\n* Time complexity: O(1) since it's a simple file write operation.\n\n**Main block**:\n\n* The example usage demonstrates how to use the `find_prompt_by_title` function to search for a prompt with a specific title.\n* It then prints the found prompt or a message indicating that no prompt was found.\n\nOverall, the code is well-organized, and the functions are relatively simple and efficient. However, the `find_prompt_by_title` function has a time complexity of O(n), which could be improved if the templates are very large. One possible optimization would be to use a more efficient data structure, such as a dictionary with title keys, to store the prompts.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
        "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the conversation:\n\n**Main Topics:** Code analysis, time complexity, and optimization suggestions for a Python script that loads, searches, and saves prompt templates from a JSON file.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The code consists of three functions: `load_templates`, `find_prompt_by_title`, and `save_templates`.\n* `load_templates` loads a JSON file with a time complexity of O(1).\n* `find_prompt_by_title` searches for a prompt by title with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of prompts.\n* `save_templates` saves the templates to a JSON file with a time complexity of O(1).\n* The code is well-organized, but the `find_prompt_by_title` function could be optimized for large templates by using a more efficient data structure.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n* The code is generally efficient, but the `find_prompt_by_title` function could be improved for large datasets.\n* The use of memoization in the `find_prompt_by_title` function helps reduce the number of times `load_templates` is called.\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of the conversation, highlighting the main topics, key points, and conclusions reached during the code analysis discussion.",
